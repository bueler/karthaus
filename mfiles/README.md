The codes in this directory have been tested in Octave and Matlab.  For example,
start Matlab at the command line:

    $ matlab

and then look at the help files of the codes:

    >> help heat

and then run with the example options:

    >> heat(1.0,30,30,0.001,20);

To run the codes in the `ant/` subdirectory, do this first:

    >> addpath('ant/')
